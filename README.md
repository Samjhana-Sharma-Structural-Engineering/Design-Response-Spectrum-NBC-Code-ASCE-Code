NBC Code:


Clause: 4.1.1 Elastic Site Spectra:


C(T) = Ch (T)ZI 


Ch (T) = Spectral Shape Factor 


Z = Seismic Zoning Factor


I = Importance Factor


Clause: 4.1.2 The Spectral Shape factor, Ch (T) for Modal Response Spectrum Method, Nonlinear Time History Analysis, Vertical Loading and Parts and Components for relevant soil type is plotted with the different parameters. 


Ch (T) =   1 + (α-1)*  T/T_a   if T< T_a


   α  if  T_a ≤ T ≤ T_c

   
   α [k+(1-k) ( T_c/T)^2 ] ( T_c/T)^2 if  T_c≤ T≤ 6
   
Where,
α – Peak Spectral Acceleration Normalized by PGA
T_a and T_c – Lower and Upper Periods of the flat part of the spectrum
K – Coefficient that controls the descending branch of the specimen
Where, 
Parameters\Soil Type	Soil Type A	Soil Type B	Soil Type C	Soil Type D
T_a	0.1	0.1	0.1	0.5
T_c	0.5	0.7	1.0	2.0
α	2.5	2.5	2.5	2.25
             K	1.8	1.8	1.8	0.8
Soil Type A: Stiff or Hard Soil Sites
Soil Type B: Medium Soil Sites
Soil Type C: Soft Soil Sites
Soil Type D: Very Soft Soil Sites
