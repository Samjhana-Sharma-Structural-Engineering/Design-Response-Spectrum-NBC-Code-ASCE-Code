NBC Code:

Clause: 4.1.1 Elastic Site Spectra:

C(T) = Ch (T)ZI 

Ch (T) = Spectral Shape Factor 

Z = Seismic Zoning Factor

I = Importance Factor

**Clause: 4.1.2** The Spectral Shape factor, Ch (T) for Modal Response Spectrum Method, Nonlinear Time History Analysis, Vertical Loading and Parts and Components for relevant soil type is plotted with the different parameters. 

Ch (T) =   1 + (α-1)*  T/T_a   if T< T_a

α  if  T_a ≤ T ≤ T_c

α [k+(1-k) ( T_c/T)^2 ] ( T_c/T)^2 if  T_c≤ T≤ 6
   
Where,

α – Peak Spectral Acceleration Normalized by PGA

T_a and T_c – Lower and Upper Periods of the flat part of the spectrum

K – Coefficient that controls the descending branch of the specimen

Where,

Soil Type A: Stiff or Hard Soil Sites

Soil Type B: Medium Soil Sites

Soil Type C: Soft Soil Sites

Soil Type D: Very Soft Soil Sites

For, 

Enter the Site Class (A, B, C, D, or E): E

Enter the value of Ss: 1.4

Enter the value of Ss: 0.4

Fa: 0.9
